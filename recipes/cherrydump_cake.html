        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A cherry dump cake is a simple dessert recipe that is made by dumping cans of cherry pie filling 
            into a baking dish, topping it with a boxed cake mix and butter. The result is an ultra moist,
            fruity, and slightly crumbly cake that’s impossible to resist.
