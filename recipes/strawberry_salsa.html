            Important notes on strawberry salsa recipe. Make sure to wipe the strawberries and not wash 
            them as to ensures the fruit doesn't absorb a lot of water. Pick strawberries that are red
            through and through. An underripe strawberry will be white or slightly greenish at the top. 
            They are sour and the Indian style strawberry salsa will require more refined sugar and might 
            still taste a little sour.
