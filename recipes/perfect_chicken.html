        <h1>Perfect Chicken</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Boneless, skinless chicken breasts (aka BSCBs) — is there anything more boring? They are all 
            too often overcooked until dry and chewy, and I generally prefer more succulent boneless, 
            skinless thighs. But for lunch and dinner favorites like chicken Caesar salad and chicken pasta, 
            sliced juicy chicken breasts can’t be beat. They’re a great staple for quick lunches, too.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fortunately I have one method that makes unfailingly juicy and tender boneless, skinless 
            chicken breasts. Need some chicken for a salad, or to top some pasta? This is the method. 
            It takes some trust, but believe me — it works flawlessly every single time.
        </p>
        <p>
            This method takes trust; you can’t check the chicken breasts or watch them cooking. 
            The method isn’t searing, sautéing, broiling, frying, or baking; it heats the chicken breasts 
            quickly on the stovetop then lets them essentially poach from the inside out in their juices in 
            a covered pan.
        </p>
        <p>
            So you can’t peek, and you have to trust us. But I promise that if you follow this method exactly, 
            you won’t be disappointed.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 cup white wine</li>
            <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried sage</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
            <li>½ cup cornstarch, or as needed</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pour the chicken broth into a saucepan with the onion and garlic; bring to a boil and cook at a boil 
                until the liquid reduces by half, about 10 minutes. Pour in the white wine, return to a boil, and 
                reduce the liquid by half again, about 10 minutes. Stir in mushrooms, rosemary, and sage; simmer 
                until the mushrooms are tender and have given up their juice, about 15 more minutes. Stir in cream, 
                butter, lemon, and capers; reduce heat and simmer the sauce until thickened, about 10 minutes 
                (45 minutes in all).
            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
                Place the cornstarch into a shallow bowl and press the chicken thighs into the cornstarch on all sides 
                until thoroughly coated. Shake off excess cornstarch. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat;
                pan-fry the chicken thighs until they develop a golden brown crust, about 8 minutes per side. Place 
                the chicken thighs into a 9x9-inch baking dish and pour the sauce over the chicken.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbling and the chicken is no longer pink in 
                the center, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a 
                chicken thigh should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </li>
        </ol>
